Documents comprehensive UI improvements to the optimization queue system: enhanced model status table with row striping, status icons, progress bars, column distribution improvements, status alignment using flex containers, summary statistics cards, tabbed interface for different job states, real-time updates, batch management features, improved action controls for job management, and the new 'Merged' job status logic and terminology throughout the UI. The batch progress summary row, summary cards, tabs, and banners now all use 'Merged' (with icon) instead of 'Skipped', and tooltips plus a 'Learn more' button provide user-friendly explanations to reduce confusion about data freshness and job deduplication.
