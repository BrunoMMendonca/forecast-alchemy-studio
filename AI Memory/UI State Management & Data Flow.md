# UI State Management & Data Flow: A Technical Guide

*This document outlines the application's core pattern for managing UI state, fetching data, and ensuring a consistent user experience.*

## 1. Core Problem / Use Case

In a complex application with multiple, asynchronous data sources (like a backend job queue), it's easy for different UI components to fall out of sync. For example, a button might show a "Processing..." state while a popup window shows that the queue is empty. These inconsistencies lead to a confusing and buggy user experience.

The central challenge is to create a predictable and robust data flow that ensures all parts of the UI are always rendering from the same, up-to-date state.

## 2. How it Works: The "Single Source of Truth" Pattern

To solve this, we use a "Single Source of Truth" pattern. This means that for any given piece of data, there is only one component responsible for fetching and managing it.

### A. Architectural Flow

1.  **Page-Level Data Fetching**: A high-level "Page" component (e.g., `src/pages/ForecastPage.tsx`) is responsible for calling all the necessary data hooks (`useBackendJobStatus`, `useGlobalSettings`, etc.). It owns the state.

2.  **Pass State Down as Props**: This Page component then passes the data and any necessary state setters down to its children as props. For example, `ForecastPage` passes the `jobs` and `summary` objects to the `MainLayout` component.

3.  **"Dumb" Child Components**: Child components (`MainLayout`, `JobMonitorButton`, `OptimizationQueuePopup`) are designed to be "dumb." They do not fetch their own data. They simply receive props and render the UI based on them.

4.  **Default Props for Safety**: To prevent crashes on the initial render (when data might not have arrived yet), components that receive objects as props should provide a default, empty state. For example, a component receiving a `summary` object initializes it with `summary = { total: 0, ... }`.

### B. Benefits of this Pattern

-   **Consistency**: Eliminates race conditions and ensures all UI elements are always in sync.
-   **Predictability**: Makes the data flow easy to trace. You always know where the data is coming from (the page-level component).
-   **Maintainability**: Simplifies debugging. If there's a UI bug, you start by looking at the data being passed from the parent page.

## 3. Key Code Pointers

| Area                     | File / Component                     | Key Function / Hook   | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State Owner / Parent** | `src/pages/ForecastPage.tsx`         | `useBackendJobStatus` | Fetches all job data and owns the state.                               |
| **Child Layout**         | `src/components/MainLayout.tsx`      | - (Receives props)    | Receives job data as props and passes it to further children.          |
| **Child Component**      | `src/components/JobMonitorButton.tsx`| - (Receives props)    | Renders UI based on the `summary` prop. Has a default value for safety.|
| **Child Component**      | `src/components/OptimizationQueuePopup.tsx` | - (Receives props) | Renders UI based on `jobs` and `summary` props. Has defaults.        |

## 4. "Gotchas" & Historical Context

- **The Job Queue Sync Bug**: The initial implementation had the `JobMonitorButton` and `OptimizationQueuePopup` calling `useBackendJobStatus` independently. This caused them to have separate, out-of-sync states, leading to the UI inconsistency bug. The solution was to move the hook call up to `ForecastPage` and pass the state down, solidifying the "Single Source of Truth" pattern.
- **The Settings Toggle Bug**: A similar bug occurred where a settings toggle (`Enable AI Reasoning`) appeared not to save its state. The root cause was the same: a component (`FloatingSettingsButton`) received the necessary props from its parent but failed to pass them down to its child (`ForecastSettings`). This broke the data flow chain, preventing the state update function from reaching the component that needed it.
- **Prop Drilling**: While this pattern can sometimes lead to "prop drilling" (passing props through many layers), it is the correct choice for our application's current scale to ensure stability and predictability. For more complex state, a more advanced state manager could be considered in the future, but is not currently necessary.

## 5. Future Evolution: API-Driven State

The "Single Source of Truth" pattern becomes even more critical when moving to a fully authenticated, backend-driven architecture.

- **The Core Change**: Instead of hooks like `useUnifiedState` reading from `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`, they will be refactored to make authenticated `fetch` calls to the backend API.
- **The Pattern Holds**: The page-level component (e.g., `ForecastPage`) will be responsible for triggering these API calls and holding the fetched data in its state. It will still pass this data down to child components as props.
- **Example Flow**:
    1. `ForecastPage` mounts.
    2. A `useEffect` hook triggers a fetch to `GET /api/datasets/:id`.
    3. The response data is stored in the page's state.
    4. The page re-renders, passing the dataset down to components like `DataVisualization` as a prop.

This evolution preserves the predictability of our data flow while migrating the application's source of truth from the client's browser to the central backend.

## 6. Auto-Loading Loading State (Recently Implemented)

**Problem**: When the app auto-loads the last dataset on startup, there was a brief flash of the "Choose your data" step before the dataset loaded and the app navigated to step 1.

**Solution**: Implemented a loading state that prevents the flash by showing a loading spinner instead of the normal "Choose your data" content during auto-loading.

**Implementation**:
- Added `isAutoLoading` state to `MainLayout.tsx` that starts as `true`
- Modified `StepContent.tsx` to show a loading spinner when `isAutoLoading` is true
- The loading state is set to `false` only after auto-loading completes (success or failure)

**Key Code Points**:
- **State Management**: `MainLayout.tsx` → `isAutoLoading` state
- **Loading UI**: `StepContent.tsx` → case 0 loading condition
- **State Reset**: Auto-loading useEffect → `setIsAutoLoading(false)` in finally block

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates jarring UI transitions during app startup
- Provides clear feedback that auto-loading is in progress
- Maintains consistent visual structure during loading
- Improves perceived performance and user experience

## 7. Globalized State for Modal Controls (Recently Implemented)

**Problem**: When implementing the fullscreen data clean modal, the controls (SKU selector, z-score selector, navigation buttons) needed to maintain consistency between the modal and the main app. Changes in the modal should immediately update the main app and vice versa.

**Solution**: Implemented a globalized state pattern where modal controls share the same state as the main app, ensuring seamless synchronization.

**Implementation**:
- **SKU Selector**: The same SKU selection state is used in both modal and main app
- **Z-Score Selector**: Z-score threshold changes are immediately reflected in both contexts
- **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next buttons maintain consistent state
- **Chart Data**: Both modal and main chart use the same data source and fallback logic

**Key Code Points**:
- **State Sharing**: Modal components receive the same state and setters as main app
- **Immediate Updates**: Changes in modal immediately update main app state
- **Consistent Display**: Both contexts show the same data and selections
- **Seamless UX**: Users can switch between modal and main app without losing context

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates state inconsistencies between modal and main app
- Provides seamless user experience when switching contexts
- Maintains data integrity across all views
- Simplifies state management by using single source of truth

## 8. Floating UI Elements (Recently Implemented)

**Problem**: The Job Monitor button was positioned at the bottom right, overlapping with toasts and other UI elements. The logo and branding were not prominently displayed, and the overall layout needed improvement.

**Solution**: Implemented dedicated floating containers for key UI elements, improving layout and branding.

**Implementation**:
- **Job Monitor & Setup Buttons**: Moved to a dedicated floating container at top right
- **Logo Branding**: Moved logo to a floating container at top left, removed header title
- **Container Positioning**: Used fixed positioning with proper z-index management
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensured buttons don't overlap with other elements

**Key Code Points**:
- **Floating Containers**: Dedicated containers for buttons and logo outside main layout
- **Fixed Positioning**: Uses CSS fixed positioning for consistent placement
- **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering to prevent overlaps
- **Professional Branding**: Prominent logo placement for better brand recognition

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates UI element overlaps
- Improves professional appearance with prominent branding
- Better organization of key controls
- Consistent positioning across different screen sizes

## 9. Chart Data Consistency (Recently Implemented)

**Problem**: The chart in the fullscreen modal was using the same data twice, and there were inconsistencies between how the main chart and modal chart displayed original vs. cleaned series.

**Solution**: Implemented consistent chart data logic across all views using the same fallback pattern.

**Implementation**:
- **Unified Data Building**: Both modal and main chart build single array with `originalSales` and `cleanedSales` fields
- **Consistent Fallback**: Both use `cleanedData.length > 0 ? cleanedData : originalData` logic
- **Same Data Source**: Both contexts use the same data arrays and processing logic
- **Visual Consistency**: Original series ("Actuals") and cleaned series display consistently

**Key Code Points**:
- **Data Structure**: Single array with both original and cleaned sales data
- **Fallback Logic**: Consistent logic for determining which series to display
- **Series Naming**: "Actuals" for original data, "Cleaned" for processed data
- **State Synchronization**: Chart data updates immediately when cleaning changes are made

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates chart display inconsistencies
- Prevents chart from disappearing when switching contexts
- Maintains data integrity across all views
- Provides consistent user experience

## Model State Management & Parameter Flow (2024-06)

### Centralized Model State
- `useModelState` hook manages all model configurations and parameters
- `useModelParameters` fetches model metadata from backend and transforms to frontend format
- Model state includes enabled/disabled status, parameter sets, and optimization results
- State updates trigger appropriate UI re-renders and backend synchronization

### Parameter Control Flow
- **Active Parameters**: Models maintain separate parameter sets (manual, grid, ai) with active set tracking
- **Method Selection**: Users can switch between Manual/Grid/AI parameter sources via badges
- **Optimization Integration**: Grid and AI optimization results are stored separately and can be applied
- **Copy Best to Manual**: Users can copy optimized parameters to manual for further tuning

### State Synchronization
- Parameter changes update both local state and parent components
- Optimization results are cached and displayed with confidence indicators
- Model eligibility state is recalculated when data or SKU changes
- Settings changes propagate through the component tree automatically

### Error Handling & Validation
- Parameter values are validated against min/max constraints
- Type safety ensures numeric parameters are properly handled
- Fallback values prevent undefined parameter errors
- Clear error messages guide users when models are ineligible
